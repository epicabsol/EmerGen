Emergen: Emergent Interactive Character Sheet

This is an interactive character sheet and dice roller for the Emergent tabletop RPG.

I'm not a Vue expert - consider yourself warned =)

Project Goals
-------------

 - Character can be saved/loaded to JSON, resistant to game data updates
 - All stats and functionality of the official character sheet is implemented
 - All official content (power details, items, weapons, fears, etc) is implemented, but homebrew is also supported

Non-Goals (For Now)
-------------------

 - Networking of any kind
 - Map view
 - Multiple characters at once

npm install
```

Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
